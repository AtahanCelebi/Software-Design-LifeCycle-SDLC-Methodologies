###Software Design LifeCycle (SDLC) Methodologies
#####SDLC - Agile
#One of the simplest and effective process today’s software solutions. It contains continual planning, learning, 
#team collaboration, development. The important thing with this methodology is a team can manage a project by breaking 
#it up into several stages and iteration at every stage.

#This methodology is effective because it clarifies the customer’s expectations on the project and the project team. 
#The Agile methodology begins client describing how the end product will be used and what problem it will solve. 
#We can say briefly, The Agile builds products that customers want will with using short cycles of work that allow for rapid production and constant revision if necessary.


##SDLC -  Extreme Programming (XP)

#One of the most suitable for todoy’s world methodology for a project managemant. This methodology is very helpful if there is constantly changing demands from customers. This methodology provides changing the project plan, budget, and even the final deliverable to fit changing needs, no matter how far along the project is. 
#It releases frequently of the product in short development cycles, which introduces a checkpoint where any customer requirements can be easily implemented.

#Rather than the other mothodologies, XP Methodology contains an importent things in software development which is listening.
#Business requirements are gathered in terms of stories. You have to learn what the problem is in the first place.You probably won't know 
#this yourself, so you have to get good at listening to clients - users, managers, and business people. 
#So all the stories you have listened stored in a place called the parking lot. And with the short cycles these are solved and released


##SDLC - The V-Model

#In software development methodology The V-Model is unique linear development model which is focuses on a looks like typical waterfall
#The V-shape of the V-Model method represents the various stages that will be passed through during the software development life cycle.

#Every single phase in the development cycle, there is a directly associated testing phase. This is a highly-disciplined model and the next phase starts only after completion of the previous phase.
#Effectiveness of this project is begins with the understand the customer’s perspective. Once you have the clear and detailed product requirements you can design system.
#So V-Model contains Verification phases on one side of the Validation phases on the other side. Verification and Validation phases are joined by coding phase in V-shape.
#it is based on the association of a testing phase for each corresponding development stage.
